NOTE: To set up please check through the POM files as you will need to specify target URL for RPM creation.

Set up a session
    curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '{"commonWhen":{"any":[{"all":[{"url":{"contains":"/api/"}},{"param":{"name":{"eq":"foo"},"value":{"eq":"1234"}}}]},{"all":[{"url":{"contains":"/www/"}},{"param":{"name":{"eq":"bar"},"value":{"eq":"1234"}}}]}]}}' http://mockserverURL/sessions > resp.html

look in resp.html to see the id of the session you just created


set up an expectation in that session
    curl -H "content-type:application/json" -d '{"when":{"url":{"endsWith":"getallnodes"}},"then":{"sequentially":[{"respond":{"code":"200","contentType": "text/html","body":"<html><body>firstCall</body></html>"}},{"respond":{"code":"200","contentType": "text/html","body":"<html><body>middleCall</body></html>"}},{"respond":{"code":"200","contentType": "text/html","body":"<html><body>lastCall</body></html>"}}]}}' http://mockserverURL/expectations?sessionId=1 > resp.html


To deploy the mock server onto a box:
-make sure the bf-dev-applications-nexus.repo has been added to the /etc/yum.repos.d directory
[bf-dev-applications-nexus]
name=bf-dev-applications-nexus
baseurl=https://repositoryURL
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
priority=90

Then to install the mock server run this command:
    sudo yum install bf-mock-server

To install the web interface, add the repo above and run:
    sudo yum install bf-mock-server-interface

You can update the mock server or web interface by running:
    sudo yum update bf-mock-server
    sudo yum update bf-mock-server-interface

After installing or updating the mock server or web interface it is a good idea to restart it:
    sudo /etc/init.d/bf-mock-server restart
    sudo /etc/init.d/bf-mock-server-interface restart

If there is no update available after making a change, make sure the jenkins job has finished/passed that uploads it to the nexus repository.
This jenkins job is currently located at:
    http://jenkinsjobURL



Alternatively, you can deploy it manually by doing the following:

    to deploy on <Box yoy wish to deploy to>
    scp mock-server.war onto the box

    sudo /sbin/service tomcat7 stop
    sudo rm -r /usr/share/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT
    sudo rm /usr/share/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT.war
    sudo mv mock-server.war /usr/share/tomcat7/webapps/ROOT.war
    sudo /sbin/service tomcat7 start
